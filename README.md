# flask
flask projects
you need to create a virtual environment with pip, and the same mysql schema for the app to work correctly. squema script with triggers, stored procedures stored in the folder titled "db".

all API keys and db passwords marked in script code as 'HIDDEN'

this app is for my own learning, including some light javascript with the template. the code is not perfect, but hey, we all gotta start somewhere!

the reason i chose flask over django, is that i wanted to choose something with as little helper functions or add-ons as possible. meaning i would like to understand how everything works from it's most basic level - with using stored procedures directly from the database instead of configuring models, migrations etc. also the forms are pure html, not flask forms. 

i found it interesting using pandas as a method of organizing data, which can also be rendered on the template system just fine. it is also useful for manipulating table structure in the back end.
